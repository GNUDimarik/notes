The following is a setup guide for Android NDK development on OSX.
It's assumed that Eclipse and ADT plugin are already present.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS******
1. SDK and NDK setup
2. Updating the NDK

BEGIN: 1. SDK and NDK setup
1. Download Apple developer tools (ie xcode), this includes utilities such as "make" among others.
2. Java JDK 6 or higher required, check with: $javac -version
3. Download and extract Android SDK from developer site. Extracted location will be referred as <Android_SDK_path> from here on.

	export ANDROID_SDK=<Android_SDK_path>
	export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK/tools:$ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools
5. In Eclipse|Preferences, select Android on the left panel and Browse to locate and set the Android SDK root directory.
6. Run "android" in terminal or open Android SDK Manager in Eclipse to download and install necessary tools.
7. Download and extract Android NDK to <Android_NDK_path>
8. Again, in ~/.profile:
	export ANDROID_NDK=<Android_NDK_path>
	export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK/tools:$ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools:$ANDROID_NDK
9. Start a new terminal when .profile is edited, go to samples/hello-jni in the NDK directory, type "ndk-build", if build successful, then the NDK is set up correctly.
END: 1. SDK and NDK setup

BEGIN: 2. Updating the NDK
1. download the latest NDK from the developer site
2. re-point the exports in .profile to the new NDK directory
END: 2. Updating the NDK
